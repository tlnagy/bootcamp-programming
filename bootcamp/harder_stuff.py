# The point of this function is to calculate the enrichment scores for a single
# experiment--the probability that the list of genes is positively or negatively
# enriched for specific groups of genes.
#
# There are many ways to do this--one way is to consider the top (or bottom) N genes,
# and ask if they are significantly enriched for a given annotation. The test for this
# is called the hypergeometric distribution:
#   http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.hypergeom.html
#
# inputs:
# - a list of [(gene name, gene value) ... ]
# - a dictionary of {GOID: [list of genes associated with this term]}
# - an int, N, to use as a parameter
#
# outputs:
# - a list of GOIDs, with associated enrichment scores,
#   testing for positive enrichment (sorted from most significant to least)
# - another list of GOIDs and enrichment scores,
#   testing for negative enrichment (again sorted)
#

# It would be useful to group experiments together. This function is one way to
# do that: for a given experiment, figure out which experiments are most similar
# and return them as a list (of integers)
#
# inputs:
# - the index for a single experiment (an int: 0, 1, ..)
# - a list or dictionary that maps from id to experiment data--this will be
#   the output from easier_stuff.experiment()
# - an int, N, to use as a parameter
#
# outputs:
# - a list of the N most similar experiments (determined however you like)
#

    return None


# The more general version of the above function is to cluster the experiments.
# You should have heard something about clustering already, I hope. The idea for this
# function is to make heatmap of clustered experiments, save it to a file, and return
# the path to that file. Alternatively you can make whatever image you think will be
# useful.
#
# input:
# - a list or dictionary that maps from the id of an experiment (an int: 0, 1, ..)
#   to a list of (systematic name, fold-change value) tuples--this will be the output
#   from easier_stuff.experiment()
#
# output:
# - the path to a figure
#
# The function should plot a summary figure for all the experiments (whatever you like,
# but perhaps a clustering?), save the figure as an image, and return the path to that
# figure. Note: you should save the figure somewhere in the "bootcamp" folder but you
# should omit that name from the return value.
#
# e.g. plot_experiment_overview(exp_data) saves a figure to "bootcamp/static/a_figure.png"
#      and it returns the path "static/a_figures.png" as its output
#

# You can make your website fancier by creating a figure for each experiment
# We've set it up for you to use mpld3 for this.
# Read their website to get started: http://mpld3.github.io/index.html

# input:
# - a list of [(gene name, gene value) ... ]
#
# output:
# - a dictionary, created by the mpld3 module from a figure you've made (see below)
#

# You can make your website extremely fancy with some networks. The idea is to
# create a network with two types of nodes: genes and go terms.
# - A gene is connected to every go term it is annotated with.
# - A go term is connected to every gene it annotates.
#
# inputs:
# - a goid or gene systematic name
# - a flag that is True when the previous input is a goid
# - an int n that describes how many steps in the network
#
# outputs:
# - a dictionary containing two keys: 'nodes' and 'links'
#   'nodes' : a list of node dictionaries, of the form:
#             {'id': goid or gene systematic name,
#               'name': go or gene name
#               'node_type': go aspect or 'gene'}
#   'links' : a list of edge dictionaries, of the form:
#             {'source': index of the source node,
#              'target': index of the target node}
#   where the indexes point to nodes in the 'nodes' list
#
#  e.g. go_network('GO:0006383') returns
#  { 'nodes': [{'id': u'GO:0006383',
#               'name': 'transcription from RNA polymerase III promoter',
#               'node_type': 'P'},
#              {'id': 'YAL001C', 'name': 'TFC3', 'node_type': 'gene'},
#              {'id': 'YBR123C', 'name': 'TFC1', 'node_type': 'gene'},
#              ...],
#    'links': [{'source': 0, 'target': 1},
#              {'source': 0, 'target': 2},
#              {'source': 0, 'target': 3}
#              ...]
